# Whether to recurse into subdirectories and sort all found files and directories in one go, instead of sorting each directory when we come across it.
# Note: only applies to always_sort, since sort: and rsort: control the recursion in explicit sorting

# Default sorting method, used if one is not explicitly provided. Must be one of: name, date, size, random

# Default file/directory precedence (which to sort first), used if one is not explicitly provided. Must be one of: files, dirs, mix

# Use alphanumeric sort instead of naive character sort. Ie., sort names by taking the numerical values into account.
